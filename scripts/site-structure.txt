Bases:
    Desktop:
        Title, framer to left of settings div, listed menu options across top
    Mobile:
        title, settings icon that expands to menu, framer above settings div

Modules (max two per page)
    Settings:
        html and css modules that are loaded with jquery into the settings div

Shared JS:
    all pre-existing modules
    gl.js, rotate.js, resize.js

need to move rotation functions into separate file, specific to manual control
BUT ROTATION ANIMATIONS PERSIST this is important, how do we do that?
could have resize.js be the main hub, execute other js files dynamically

If I choose a multiple-page design, im looking at cookies, php, all that server-side stuff to retain information
about the user and the animations

and I really want to try this design.
