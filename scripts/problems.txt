Shaders:
    During rotations, none of the extrusions shade correctly.
    The 8 extrusions that connect the cube in 3d space to the cube in 4d space are always black.
    All other extrusions alternate their shading as if the point light suddenly jumped from one side to the other.

Disappearances:
    Once you apply any transformation to the extrusions, some of them will disappear at certain camera angles.
    TODO: Check if it is referencing by making a new extrusion with the same shape, curve, and position as extrusion 22,
        which is known to disappear after 100 frames of 0.01 matrix rotations on all 4d planes.
    This could also be a material problem.
    It is NOT camera clipping. The camera doesn't remove objects, only clips through them while leaving some visible.
    The offending extrusions are often within the shape, far from the frustums of the camera.
