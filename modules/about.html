    <h2>The Site</h2>

    <p> Hello visitor! This site allows you to interact with the projection of a 4d hypercube onto 3d space.
        If that doesn't immediately make sense, think about it like the shadow of a fourth-dimensional object.
        Lines cast point shadows, 2d shapes cast line shadows, 3d shapes cast 2d shadows, and 4d shapes cast 3d shadows.
        For the mathematically jaded, you can view any 4d shape using the points section of the site. (jk, its not up yet.)
