    <h2>The Site</h2>

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello visitor! This site allows you to interact with the projection of a 4d hypercube onto 3d space. These 4cubes are also called tesseracts.
        If that doesn't immediately make sense, think about it like the shadow of a fourth-dimensional object.
        Lines cast point shadows, 2d shapes cast line shadows, 3d shapes cast 2d shadows, and 4d shapes cast 3d shadows.
        If you've seen this kind of thing before, you can also view any 4d shape using the points section of the site.
    </p>
